# GNU/Linux setup

## Description
This set of scripts and configuration files aims to tweak quickly a GNU/Linux distribution up to your preferences and rebuild your usual work environement.

## How to use it
After installing GNU/Linux on a machine, fetch the whole file structure of this project anywhere on the target machine and run the **setup.sh** script.

## Licence
This code in essence has no value until it is customized. I think it is relevant to distribute it under the license WTFPL.
